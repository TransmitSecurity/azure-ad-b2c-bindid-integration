# Azure AD B2C Integration

Build app-less, passwordless login experiences with BindID for your customers and consumers that want to access your Azure AD business-to-consumer (B2C) applications.

## Description

This plugin is used to configure your Azure AD B2C applications to initiate strong authentication flows with the BindID service to sign in and sign up users to your application. You can define and customize technical profiles and user journeys to match the experiences and needs that best fit your application. End-user access to your application will continue to be handled and managed using the identity provider used by your application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, the following must be already set up (see [Azure Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c)):
- Azure AD B2C tenant linked to your Azure subscription
- Registered web application for your tenant
- Signing and encryption keys for your Identity Experience Framework
- Registered Identity Experience Framework applications (see [Azure Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/custom-policy-get-started#register-identity-experience-framework-applications))

## What is BindID?
The BindID service is an app-less, strong portable authenticator offered by Transmit Security. BindID uses FIDO-based biometrics for secure, frictionless, and consistent customer authentication. With one click to create new accounts or sign into existing ones, BindID eliminates passwords and the inconveniences of traditional credential-based logins.<br><br>
